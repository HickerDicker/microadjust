# microadjust
A simple microadjust Benchmark made in c#
this was made a while ago due to the fact that amit's powershell script would glitch out if a way too low interval was given to it
so as a c# dev I decided to make one myself with an easy to understand and simple UI
if you like this timer resolution benchmark make sure to star the repo
if you have any suggestions for the code you can make a fork and or pull request I would gladly look into it
